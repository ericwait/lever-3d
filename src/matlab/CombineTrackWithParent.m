% CombineTrackWithParent(trackID)
%Combine childTrack with its parent track - in otherwords the childtrack
%will be merged into the parent track making it all one edge.
%Afterward all of the hulls previously associated with the given track will
%be part of its parent.  The parent will inherit the grandchildren of the
%given track.
%***Make sure that the sibling of the given track has been delt with prior
%to calling this function. IT WILL BE LOST
