%ChangLabel(time,oldTrackID,newTrackID)
%This will attempt to change the trackID from a given time until the end of
%the track.  However, the trackID will only be changed up to the point that
%the newTrackID does not exist.  If when moving hulls from the oldTrack to
%the newTrack, there is a hull already in the newTrack for a given frame,
%this function will return without moving any more hulls.
%
%If the whole oldTrack ends up moving over to the newTrack, and the
%oldTrack has a sibling, the oldTrack's sibling will be merged into the
%parent.
%
%Anytime that the oldTrack can be fully moved from the given time all the
%way to the endFrame of the track, the oldTrack's subtree will move with it.
%The only time that the subtree would not move with the change would be as
%stated above.
