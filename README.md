Hi! Note that we are preparing a new and much improved version of the LEVER 3-D 
software. For more information, contact acohen 'at' coe.drexel.edu. Thanks!

NVIDIA CUDA toolkit EULA can be found at [CUDA EULA](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/eula/index.html#axzz3EoF66FNY)

To run LEVER 3-D executable you will need the following:
MATLAB's runtime called MCR [version 8.3 (R2014a)](http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html)
Visual C++ Redistributable for [Visual Studio 2013](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784)

DirectX 11 runtime (for Windows 7, no need on Windows 8) and capable device
[DirectX 11](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35)

To process images you will need:
A CUDA compute 3.5 capable device or better

Once all of the above prerequisites have been met, run the LEVER3D.exe from the same directory as:
`DefaultMeshShaders.fx`
`ViewAlignedVertexShader.fx`

The program will open and ask for a metadata file.  Please see example dataset [here](http://bioimage.coe.drexel.edu/info/?page_id=620)

The metadata needs to be in the same directory as the tiff files.
The tiff files need to be named such that the following sprintf line will find
each file `sprintf('%s_c%02d_t%04d_z%04d.tif',datasetName,channel,frame,zSlice)`

Please see 'Additional Files 3' of BMC paper for a video tutorial of the user interface.
